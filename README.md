1. Enter the number of bombs you desire
2. Enter the x coordinate you wish to change (x is the row you wish to change)
3. Enter the y coordinate you wish to change (y is the column you wish to change)
4. Enter either "mine" or "free" to choose if you want to mark the coordinate as a suspected location of a mine or as a free space
